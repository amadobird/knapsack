      the wordmark creating a clean and boldly a ective brand identity. The use of all caps brings a modern sense of strength and stability.

<h4>Minimum Size</h4>
<p>The smallest the Basalt logo should be presented is 1.5 inches wide, when representing the logo on a scale below 1.5 inches, it is best to use the icon only.</p>
<h3>Construction</h3>
<p>The Basalt logo has been constructed with care,
  to ensure that it is always legible in context it is important to maintain theminimum “clear space”. This space isolates the logo from any potentially competing graphic elements or margins that may con ict with the impact of the logo.</p>
<p>The clear space is equal to the width of the ‘B’ to preserve proportions.</p>

    <p>Exercise care when placing the logo mark over photographic backgrounds. It’s important to ensure that the logomark does not compete with elements in the photo and always remains legible. In most cases either a solid white or solid black logo on top of a background image will work.</p>
    <h4>Tips</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Avoid busy images with lots of detail</li>
      <li>When working with high contrast images, turn down the opacity for better legibility</li>
      <li>Apply overlays when appropriate</li>
      <li>Photos with a shallow depth-of-field work well</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Tips</h4>
    <ul>
      <li>Overlays should come all the way to at least 1 edge</li>
      <li>Overlays should be placed at 80%–50% opacity</li>
      <li>Overlays work best when either text or graphic elements are placed within them.</li>
