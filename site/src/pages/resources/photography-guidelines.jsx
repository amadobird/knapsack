      <p>
        Photography is a powerful tool in telling a story within your brand
        materials. To evoke a sense of wonder and adventure and still feel
        relatable modern, and relevant to the service and industry Basalt is
        part of I suggest using a combination of photos that depict the natural
        world, photos that use repetitive geometric and natural patterns, and
        photos that depict a potential user in situation.
