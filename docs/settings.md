## Overview
This section covers the various settings which are easily and conveniently configurable via your browser User Interface. 

## Site Settings
This section is accessible via the link in the footer, titled <a href="http://localhost:3999/settings" target="_blank">Site Settings</a>.

**Options to configure are included below:**

#### Knapsack Settings, such as..
* Title
* Subtitle
* Slogan

#### Parent Brand, such as..
* Logo
* Title
* Homepage

#### Custom Sections
1) Adding another item to this section will create a new "Custom Section". If you wish for this new section to appear in the top Main Menu, toggle the "Show in Main Menu" option.
2) Next you will add your custom pages within the new Custom Section you just added. Those pages will appear in the left sidebar under the heading for the new Custom Section.
3) Now you can open those pages within your browser and edit the page to include custom blocks and other rich content.

#### Pattern Types
Naming things is hard; Knapsack isn't. This section allows you to add or edit the pattern types within the system to best suit your needs.

#### Pattern Statuses
Same thing as "Pattern Types" above. Here you can configure the states of the patterns within the system.
